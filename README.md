# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This project showcases the various web apps, games, and other projects I've developed and worked on. I've built a lot of stuff over the years, and it's about time that I collect it all in one place.

## Projects and Blog Posts

One of the standout features of my portfolio is the ability to convert Markdown files into dynamic blog/project posts and image slideshows. This functionality allows for easy content management and seamless updates to the site as I add new projects and blog posts. Additionally, I'm always writing project README's w/ Markdown, so I'm able to keep my site updated without any effort.

### How It Works

- **Markdown Parsing**: Each project and blog post is written in Markdown format, which is then parsed into HTML. Styled with Tailwind, and then animated with CSS & Svelte transitions. This enables the use of rich text formatting, links, images, and more, making it easy to create visually appealing content.

- **Dynamic Rendering**: The parsed content is dynamically rendered on the site, ensuring that any updates to the Markdown files are immediately reflected in the user interface. This means I'm able to add new projects or blog entries without needing to modify the underlying code.

- **Structured Data**: Each Markdown file includes metadata such as title, description, and publication date, which is utilized to organize and display the content effectively. This structured approach enhances SEO and improves the overall user experience.

This not only simplifies content creation but also enriches the portfolio, allowing visitors to explore my work and thoughts in a structured and engaging manner.

## Technologies Used

- **Svelte 5**: A modern frontend framework that compiles to highly optimized JavaScript.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **DaisyUI**: A CSS component library for building beautiful UIs with TailwindCSS.
- **TypeScript**: TBH, I just like it more than JavaScript.

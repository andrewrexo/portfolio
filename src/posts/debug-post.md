looooook. it's markdown. you're actually being fed this page via a .md markdown file. how cool is that?

```ts
() => {
  console.log("it's coding time");
};
```

if you're seeing this, then i'd be curious to know how you got here.

but.. if you're reading this, then you're probably here because you're a developer.

and if you're a developer, then you're probably also on twitter. so, if you see this, and you're on twitter, hit me up! my username is [**@drdreidelrx**](https://twitter.com/drdreidelrx)

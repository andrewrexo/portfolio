## Features

This was a learning project that helped me get more familiar with using wagmi/viem and the solana web3 wallet adapter. It's got quite a few features already:

1. Bridging EVM tokens via https://hop.exchange/ api
2. Dynamic styles: allowing 3rd parties to integrate the widget with ease
3. Multi-wallet connections: Solana and EVM network wallets can be connected and prompted on demand
4. Loading user's token balances & USD prices on connected networks
5. Accessible and sleek UI: built with accessability best practices in mind. Components carefully crafted by hand

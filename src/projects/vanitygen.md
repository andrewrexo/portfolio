## How it works

It will generate a random key pair, and check the public key hash against the search term you provide. If a match is found, it will print the key pair to the console.

## Installation

1. `git clone https://github.com/Qwiddle/tezos-vanity-gen.git`
2. `cd tezos-vanity-gen`
3. `yarn`

## Usage

`yarn start <search term> [-cs (case sensitive)]`

## Example

`yarn start Qwiddle -cs` will search for an address that starts with `tz1Qwiddle`
